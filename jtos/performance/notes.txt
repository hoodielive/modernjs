Honey I shrunk the files.. 
The traveling delivery man.. 

Reduce the file size: 
- Minimize Text - minifier, uglify, remove space
- Minimize Images - svg, jpg, gif, png - always pick the 'right' image file formats that works 
	
	How to optimize them:
		jpegs - use for things with many colors | doesn't allow transparency | big file sizes
		gifs - limits the total colors 2 > 256 | reduction of color count is good for automation 
		pngs - limit colors | very small | excellent for logos and transparency 
		svg - vector graphics - files designers work with on indesign, sketch | can expand several times and still be
			clear and crisp | incredibly small | great for retina and 4k and can be customized for CSS. 
			Simplistic 

Miminizing Images Techniques: 
 - If you want transparency: PNG
 - If you want animations: GIF
 - If you want colorful images: JPG
 - If you want simple icons, logos and illustrations: SVGs 
 - Reduce PNG with: TinyPNG
 - Reduce JPG with JPEG-optimizer
 - Try to choose simple illustrations over highly detailed photographs
 - Always lower JPEG image quality (30-60%) 
 - Resize image based on size it will be displayed
 - Display different sized images for different backgrounds
 - Use CDNs like imigx
 - Remove image metadata
