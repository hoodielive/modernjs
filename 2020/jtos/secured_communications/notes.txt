Symmetrical Encryption -> 
	Communication is based upon a single key that encrypts and decrypts communication / packets.

Key Exchange Algorithm -> 
	The key is never transmitted to any other host, rather it utilizes public calculations to
	To decrypt packets (mathematical computation). 

Asymmetrical Encryption -> 
	Used 2 separate keys for encryption and decryption.
	Public keys.
	Private keys.
	Together they form public/private key pair.
	Share the public key to anyone, the private key will be used to decrypt after authentication.

Difiie Hellman Key Exchange -> 
	A mathematical algorithm that generates a little from both private and public to encrypt and decrypt packets.

Hashing -> 
	Bcrypt

Process
1. Diffie-Hellman Key Change.
2. Arrive at Symmetric Key.
3. Hashing to make sure there has not been tampering.
4. Authenticate user. 

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<>" -f ~/.ssh/some_key : This will generate a private and public key. The indicator for the publick key is .pub. The other is the private key and should NOT be shared with anyone. 
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/some_key
